# Module 9 Challenge: README Generator 

## Description

This project was built to design a method in easily creating a well-formatted README.md file for developers. When ran through NODE.js, a series of questions appear that reference each section in the README file. The inputted answers will be directly placed into the pre-formatted README file, allowing for a simple and convenient method in creating one of these files. This project was built so that a developer may easily create a README file while simply answering questions. This project allowed for me to apply my knowledge learned about NODE.js and the inquirer package. 

## Installation

Clone/fork this repository at https://github.com/sagirikenaga/read-me-gen. Then run the commands: npm i & index.js for the prompts to appear.

## Usage

This project is used by accessing the code through NODE, and answering the questions based on the series of prompts. After all the questions are completed, a README file is automatically produced.
